- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension installed in your browser.

## Starter Next/Hardhat Project

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/

## Connect to MetaMask
1. Install MetaMask: If you haven't already, install the MetaMask extension for your browser from MetaMask.

2. Connect to MetaMask: When you open the application, MetaMask will prompt you to connect your account. Follow the instructions to connect.
